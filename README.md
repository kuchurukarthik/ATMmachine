# ATMmachine
This is a project for ATM machine functionalities built on eclipse.
This is a static project done without using database.
For simplicity of code this code has only three usernames.(we can add as many users as we need in arrays).
When we enter correct credentials(username and password)we get a list of services provided by ATM.
Choose any service you want....
